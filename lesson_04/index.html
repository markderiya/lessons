		<h1>London is the capital of Great Britain</h1>

				<span class="paragraph">London</span> is one of the largest cities and ports in the world. It is the British
				capital, the centre of the United
				Kingdom.
				London arose from a number of towns and villages which formed <span class="italic-style">one urban area of
					1,800
					square km </span> with a population of more than 8 million people.
				<br>
				<span class="paragraph">London</span> is situated on the River Thames about forty miles from its mouth. It
				is
				divided into two unequal portions
				by the
				river, the more important part stands on the north bank.
				<br>
				<span class="paragraph">The</span> population of London is probably the most variable in the world: the
				<span class="population">English, French, Italians, Russians, Poles, Swiss, Indians, Germans,</span> etc.
				<br>
				<span class="paragraph">The</span> oldest part of London is the City, where all the business and financial
				life
				is
				concentrated on an area of
				only a
				little more than one square mile. <span class="italic-style">It is about 2,000 years old.</span>
				<br>
				<span class="paragraph">Many</span> monuments of London’s history can be found in the City. Its narrow
				streets
				are
				lined with buildings which
				house the
				offices and banks, insurance companies and trading companies. One street in this area is busy day and night.
				This
				is
				Fleet Street, in and round which nearly all important newspapers and press agencies have their offices.
				<br>
				<span class="paragraph">The</span> West End is the most beautiful residential area of London. There are
				lovely
				parks, luxurious mansions and
				elegant
				stores and restaurants, museums and hotels in the West End. The Queen lives in Buckingham Palace nowadays,
				and
				the
				Palace of Westminster is now the seat of the Parliament.
				<br>
				<span class="paragraph">One</span> of the busiest places in London is Trafalgar Square with Nelson’s column
				in
				it.
				Piccadilly is also the busiest
				spot,
				the Heart of London.
				<br>
				<span class="paragraph">The</span> East End of London is as different from the West End as can be. The East
				End
				is
				the area where the poor have
				their
				home. Their life and work concentrates round the Port of London.
				<br>
				<span class="paragraph">London</span>
				<span class="gilroy-family">is one of the biggest industrial centres of Great Britain. It gives
					1/6
					of
					manufacturing industry
					production.
					Among many important industries we can name the following: </span> <span
					class="industries">machine-building
					industry, paper and printing and publishing industry, food-stuff industry, sewing industry, etc.</span>
				<br>
				<span class="spacing"><span class="paragraph">London</span> is one of the biggest and most important
					transport centres of the country with its sea ports, airports, etc.</span>
